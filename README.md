A game I made through the Odin Project, Rock Paper Scissors in which you are against a computer.

The expereince I have gained:

-Creating a function of playerSelection vs computerSelection where they tie or if either one win or lose.

-use of document.getElementById..

-understanding the difference between textContent and innerHtml within a function updateChoices.

-Learn how to restart game after 5 rounds have finished.
